# Requirements
## Introduction
This product is a powerful tool which helps in designing and implementing electronic circuits. It has  Amplifierswhich are related to electronics. It takes input from the user through Command line and gives the output through the same.

## Research
Many websites were available which would implement only one of the features of our product alone. For example, there are pages or sites for calculating OPAMPS OUTPUT values. But we could not find anything integrated to this extent.

## State of Art
### Ageing - Time
 * Usually these type of calculations were done manually, handwritten. Even in colleges, we still practice all these manually. This project is an idea for automating all the calculations and design which will reduce the time consumed and errors committed.
### Ageing - Cost
 * The cost parameter for this project was none. All the softwares and features were freely available on the internet.
 
## 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

### Who:
 * Electical, Electronics, control systems, instrumentation engineers, students and people who need to design or use circuits related to electronics.

### What:
 * This project gives out the parameters or the values required to design or implelment the type of electronic component according to the user inputs. 

### When:
 * This project can be used whenever there is a need to implement or design electronic components.

### Where:
 * This project can be used colleges/universities,labs or even for individual uses.

### How:
