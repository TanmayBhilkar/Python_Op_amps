Before you send anyone a file attachment, check to make sure that your filename meets the
following criteria. If it does not, resave/rename your file according to these criteria. Incorrect
file names may prevent you from being able to post your file and other users from being able
to open your attachment.
Does your file name include:
any "illegal" characters?
Your filename should not contain any non-alphanumeric characters (for example, ! @ # $
% ‘ “ &, meaning that Assignment#7.rtf is wrong; Assignment7.rtf is correct.)
The only acceptable non-alphanumeric characters are an underscore ( _ ) or a hyphen ( - ).
any spaces?
Filenames should not contain any spaces. For example "Progress Report.rtf" is wrong;
"Progress_Report.rtf" or "ProgressReport.rtf" are correct.
enough information to make sense to a recipient once the file has been downloaded to
her/his computer?
